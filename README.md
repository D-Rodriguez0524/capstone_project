Hello there and welcome to my custom star wars website!!
The api website i used: https://swapi.dev/

I made this website to take data from the star wars SWAPI api but only the data that is related to 6 movies.

When you first enter the page you arre greeted with a beautiful image of a sandcastle yoda and a navbar that you can toggle. 
in the nsvbar there are links that will bring you to a list of pages:
Movies, list of all 6 movies and a list of their directors and when they were realeased.
People, this link shows you every character that is in all 6 movies of starwars.
vehicles, this link shows you every vehicles that is in all 6 movies of starwars.
Starships, this link shows you every starships that is in all 6 movies of starwars.
Species, this link shows you every species that is in all 6 movies of starwars.
Planets, this link shows you every planets that is in all 6 movies of starwars.

When you click on a person for example from the list of people. It brings you to a page that has a picture of something from the star wars films as the background
and it also displays a card like object with detailed information about the person you just clicked on.

On my website you are also able to make an account and choose whether or not you are part of th rrebellion or the darkside.

Not implemented but wanted to do.
User that logged in will have a choice to make a deck of cards with either darkside people if they chose the darkside or rebellion. 
Each person they chose would have a specific attack and a specific HP.
When they made a deck they could battle against an randomly generated deck the first to 5 total wins, wins. 
I wanted to get this implemented but i ran out of time and i think i just bit off more than i could chew with this idea

When using the api it was very slow wwhen i was pulling so much data from it so i was forced to take the api in pices and make my own json api so it would run smoother snd faster.

I hope you enjoy looking through my code and looking through the website, in the future i want to do the deck idea. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!!
